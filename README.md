# htbmachines

## Description

This will be a script intended to search for all the [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/)  machines that I have completed. It is part of the Hack4u course that will teach the basics of Cybersecurity, and offensive python.  

This script/program will be coded on bash language.

## Visuals
Placeholder for screenshots of the bash program.

## Installation
Installation will not be required, the only requirements is that the script has execution permissions.

The permissions can be given as follows:

```bash
chmod u+x ./htbmachines.sh
```

It also can be added to your /bin folder, or any binaries folder that you wish and add it to your path.
